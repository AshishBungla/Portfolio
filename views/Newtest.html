                    This project was a submission for a competition called Microsoft Design Challenge 2020. The competition aims to find digital solutions to problems in the field of learning, health and transportation in the context of the Covid-19 Pandemic.
                    <br><br>
                    For the competition, I have chosen Education & Learning as the theme.

                  <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                  <p>
                    Most of the platform that gives free learning content(Youtube, Facebook) has many distractions while studying. The reason is simple because they are not created for learning purposes. Other platforms that allow good learning content are mostly paid and hence not accessible by everyone
                  <br><br>
                  </p>
                  <p class="box-text">
                    There is a need for learning platforms that are freely accessible, allow diverse learning content without any distractions. These platforms also need to consider socialising issues that students face in the current pandemic scenario.

                    In the end, it was a great learning experience. This was my first time that i started protyping my app. This project helped me to understand issues with complex solutions and how one can resolve those issues. The user research allowed me to learn more about users and try to provide better solutions for them. 

                    <br>It was challenging and fun working on this project.
